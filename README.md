# Crack Detection in Walls Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project is aimed at developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting cracks in walls from images. It leverages deep learning techniques to identify and classify cracks, which is crucial for structural health monitoring and maintenance.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build and train a CNN to automatically detect and classify cracks in wall images. This involves preprocessing images, designing and training the CNN model, and evaluating its performance.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For developing the CNN model and processing data.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the Convolutional Neural Network.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress and results.

### Key Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques to clean and prepare images for model input.
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: Implemented to detect and classify cracks in wall images.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics and visualizations to assess the performance of the CNN model.
- **Visualization**: Tools to display detected cracks and model predictions.

### Getting Started

To start using this project, clone the repository and install the required Python libraries. You can then run the provided scripts to preprocess images, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crack-detection-cnn.git
cd crack-detection-cnn
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
python main.py
```

### Folder Structure
- `main.py`: The entry point for running image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `model.py`: Contains the CNN architecture and training routines.
- `data_loader.py`: Handles loading and preprocessing of wall images.
- `visualizations.py`: Includes functions for plotting training progress and detection results.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for various tasks related to image processing and model evaluation.

### Dataset

The project uses a dataset of wall images with annotated cracks. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory as specified in the `data_loader.py` script. If you are using a custom dataset, make sure to adjust the data loading and preprocessing steps accordingly.
